# C++ Learning Repository || STILL WORKING ON THIS 

This repository contains solutions to various C++ exercises . From different C++ books (Stroustrup). The purpose of this project is to prepare for my C++ exam by organizing tasks into separate folders based on different topics.

## Structure
Each folder represents a specific exercise or topic. The structure is as follows:
```
cpp_learning/
â”‚-- Chapter_01/
â”‚   â”‚-- exercise_1.cpp
â”‚   â”‚-- exercise_2.cpp
â”‚-- Chapter_02/
â”‚   â”‚-- exercise_1.cpp
â”‚   â”‚-- exercise_2.cpp
â”‚-- ...
```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mshupliakou/cpp_learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired chapter or exercise:
   ```sh
   cd cpp_learning/Chapter_01
   ```
3. Make a folder build:
   ```sh
   mkdir build
   ```
4. Navigate there:
   ```sh
   cd build
   ```
3. Compile and run the code:
   ```sh
   cmake ..
   make
   ./lab
   ```

## Notes
- The solutions are written in **modern C++ (C++11 or later)**.
- Some exercises may include additional files such as headers (`.h`) and separate implementation files (`.cpp`).
- Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements!

## License
This repository is for personal learning purposes. Feel free to use and modify the code as needed.
