# Function Composition in C++

This project provides an implementation of function composition in C++, allowing users to combine multiple mathematical functions and apply them sequentially to input values.

# Features

- **Function Composition**: Supports sequential application of functions.
- **Mathematical Function Classes**: Includes predefined functions like sine, square root, and linear transformations.
- **Operator Overloading**: Enables function objects to be called like regular functions.
- **Dynamic Function Insertion**: Users can add functions to the composition dynamically.
- **Intermediate Results Access**: Stores intermediate results and allows indexed retrieval.

# Files Included
