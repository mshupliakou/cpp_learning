# Name Pairs Program

This C++ program allows you to enter a list of names and ages, and then sort them alphabetically. It also includes overloaded operators for comparison and output.

## Features

- **Input names and ages**: The program reads a series of names and corresponding ages.
- **Sort names**: The names are sorted in alphabetical order, and ages are rearranged accordingly.
- **Compare pairs**: You can create two sets of name-age pairs and compare them using `==` and `!=` operators.
- **Output**: The program supports the use of the `<<` operator for displaying the names and ages in a formatted manner.
